# Twitter-based-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Two-Actresses
This project conducts comparison of popular sentiment of two actresses - Anne Hathaway and Jennifer Lawrence based on Twitter API.
We trained a XGBoost model to classify the sentiment of tweets and visualized the results using d3.js

The training dataset sould be a csv file with 3 columns: Id, Category,Tweet,
The test dataset shoud a csv file with 2 columns: Id, Tweet.
 
The main code is the classification/sentiment_analysis.ipynb
The pre-trained word2vec and dataset is large, so we didn't put them here. 

Visualization code and a sample data are in /visualization
